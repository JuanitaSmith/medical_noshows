## Project Overview
This project is completed as part of the 'Data Analyst' nanodegree with Udacity. 
The dataset,  provided by Kaggle, collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused 
on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. 
A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
The goal of the project is to demonstrate the data analyst process (question, wrangle, EDA through visualization, draw conclusion and communicate results) is well understood.
Conduct own analysis of the dataset and brainstorm what questions the dataset could answer. Use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions most interesting, and create a report sharing the conclusions.
Idea of the project was not use inferential statistics or machine learning to answer the questions, but to explore the features manually purely with python to practise plotting and data analysis skills
